# BeatControllerWithFP
This is a Beat Controller application by using MVC , Strategy Pattern and Observer Pattern.
(It's already a really clean and well-designed java application, but we could make it cleaner by using functional programming.)
The codes are cleaner and easier for maintainance after using Java 8 FP.
